## I'm just starting this project

I made this project as a portfolio everyone can access to know more about my dev life
 - This project is divided in phases I'll work on as time goes by.
 - The project will have 4 different languages upon selected would change the entire web app language including videos of me to that target language.
 - I also want to add other runnable projects I've done so everyone can use them at anytime.
 - If you have any suggestion I would very much appreciate it.
